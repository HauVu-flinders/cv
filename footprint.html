    <p>At first, really hard to built a coding habit. I made it easier by just learn for 15 minutes for the first week.
      That only 15 minutes, no less no more. But I often end up learning more than an hour.
    </p>
    <p>I felt like if I am rusting in learning quickly and want to know everything. I ended up learning nothing
      Coding is actually thinking than just only a set of rules.</p>
    <p>Now is 00:03 am, I came to bed but having a voice inside me tell me that I should write down what I feel or What I leart on coding
    "dynamic"; "static"; "percentage", "inherited from parents's font'size", it more safe to use "rem" means "root em", "M" means "em",
    "16px = 100% = 1em"
    that related to CSS font-size,</p>

    <strong>Note: I have to review "position: relative and absolute" as well.</strong></p>
